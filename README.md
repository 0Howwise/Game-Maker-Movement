# Game-Maker-Movement
A repository where I put all of my Game maker movement code.

Some of this code is from following Shaun Spalding youtube tutorials, but most will be changed over time.
Over time the code should be a basic movement for a generic 2d video game character.

Features Coved:

Sprinting, Double jumping, Sliding, Wall jumping, Flying or jetpack like feature, Shooting, and Melee.

Player movement:
